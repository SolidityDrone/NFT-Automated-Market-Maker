##Yakiswap protocol 

This is an experimental Autameted Market Maker based off NFTs.
Users can create his own pool and provide either liquidity, assets or both. They can setup parameters to manage the behaviour of the AMM.
This is intended to work in pair with a TheGraph subgraph as most events are emitted to not waste any further gas on storage.
